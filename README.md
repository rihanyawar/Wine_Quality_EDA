📊 Exploratory Data Analysis: Red Wine Quality Dataset This project contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Red Wine Quality dataset using Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. The goal of the analysis is to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights from the physicochemical properties of red wine and how they relate to wine quality.

🔧 Libraries Used pandas – for data loading, cleaning, and manipulation. matplotlib – for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations. seaborn – for statistical data visualization.

🧪 Features in the Dataset fixed acidity volatile acidity citric acid residual sugar chlorides free sulfur dioxide total sulfur dioxide density pH sulphates alcohol quality (target variable)

🔍 EDA Highlights Data Cleaning: Checked for null values, data types, and statistical summary.
Univariate Analysis: Explored distributions of individual features using histograms and boxplots.
Bivariate Analysis: Visualized relationships between features and quality using scatter plots, bar plots, and heatmaps.
Correlation Analysis: Created a correlation heatmap to identify strongly correlated variables.

📈 Visualization Examples Distribution of wine quality scores
Boxplots for acidity and alcohol by quality
Heatmap of feature correlations
Scatter plots of key features vs quality
